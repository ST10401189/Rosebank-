How It Works - 3 Steps:

1. Donate & Invest
Transfer your gift into a Donor-Advised Fund (DAF), where it's invested to grow and last.

2. Choose a Portfolio
Select from options like short-term, medium-term, long-term, and impact portfolios-each with a different balance of liquidity, return, and purpose. 

3. Distribute with Guidance
You decide when, how much, and to which charities your fund gives-flexibility that empowers focused, meaningful impact.
