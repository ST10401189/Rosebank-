# Who We Help

Tree of Life Foundation exists to connect generous donors with trusted, Christ-centred organisations making a lasting difference in South Africa. We believe that real transformation happens when resources are stewarded wisely, accountability is upheld, and vulnerable communities are served with dignity.

Every partner we support is carefully vetted to ensure:
- **Accountability & Transparency** – We only work with organisations that demonstrate responsible governance and measurable impact.
- **Christ-Centred Values** – Our partners are rooted in faith, committed to serving others through love and compassion.
- **Sustainable Transformation** – We look for long-term solutions that empower communities rather than short-term relief.

Through our partnerships, donors can give with confidence, knowing their contributions are directed to initiatives that truly change lives.  

Below are some of the organisations we currently partner with:

- [Acres of Love](partner_profiles/acres-of-love.md)  
- [Agapé Family Ministries](partner_profiles/agape-family-ministries.md)  
- [Eagles Rising Leadership Academy](partner_profiles/eagles-rising-leadership-academy.md)  

Together with our donors, these organisations are bringing hope, dignity, and opportunity to children, families, and communities across South Africa.
