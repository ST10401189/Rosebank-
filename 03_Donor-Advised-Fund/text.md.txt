What is a DAF?
A Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) is an efficient, charitable investment account allowing you to donate now and decide later which vetted charities benefit. Returns grow tax-free inside the fund, increasing the potential impact of your gift. 
Starting in 2016, this platform was offered to external donors—making TOL’s proven investment model accessible for long-term charitable giving. 

Investment Portfolios
* Short-Term Cash: Full liquidity at end of month; ideal for near-term grants. 
* Medium-Term: Mixture of listed instruments and hedge funds; 60-day notice withdrawal. 
* Long-Term Private Equity: Seeks strong returns and steady distribution (~2.5% p.a. liquidity), with values-aligned investing. 
* Impact Portfolio: Prioritizes societal benefit over returns; liquidity only via events or new inflows. 

Fees
* Platform charge: 0.45% p.a., charged quarterly. 
* Investment fees:
o Short-Term: 0.25% p.a.
o Medium-Term: 0.75% p.a. + 20% of outperformance over CPI + 3%
o Long-Term: 2% p.a. + 20% of outperformance over CPI + 5%
o Impact: 2% p.a. 
* Distribution Fee: 1% (min R500) when grants are made, helping cover overheads. 
Note: These are internal fees—any surplus remains within the charitable ecosystem per trustee direction.
