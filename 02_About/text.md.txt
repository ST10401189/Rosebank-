Our Story
Tree of Life (TOL) was founded in 2007 in South Africa, based on a vision for sustainable giving rooted in Christian values. Initially, TOL’s trustees funded the organisation through business equity—without soliciting donations. 

By 2014, TOL adopted a progressive distribution policy, allocating a meaningful percentage of its net assets annually to vetted charities—a philosophy scaled through the DAF launch in 2016. 

Mission & Values
* Steward donor capital with integrity and wisdom.
* Empower sustained charity via investment returns.
* Channel collective Christian capital into long-term impact across Africa.

Governance
TOL’s board includes seasoned professionals—from actuaries and investment managers to former corporate CEOs—ensuring strong oversight of both fiscal stewardship and donor intent.
